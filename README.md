# Extension-hide-negative-comments-Facebook
<h4>Increasing in usage of online platforms that also permits people to get across with each other, by exchanging feelings or attitudes about several events and they leave comments about their opinion. This has contributed to the evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The background for the problem statement arises from the crowd of online comments. Identifying the toxicity in comments has been a tremendous challenge for users.
  
<h4>This work is important because it has the potential to enhance user experience by limiting exposure to hazardous content while preserving the flow of productive conversations. This method gives individual users the ability to control their own online settings in accordance with their tastes, as opposed to platform-driven moderation, which could be too strict or inconsistent. In addition, sentiment-based comment filtering can be extremely helpful in addressing the increasing problem of online harassment and negativity while also promoting mental health.</h4>
<h4>A sentiment-labeled dataset, an NLP-based filtering system, and a real-time Chrome extension that uses these tools form the foundation of this work's structure. The first step of the project is to choose and analyze a dataset of Facebook comments that have been classified as either favorable, neutral, or negative. The content script of the addon uses this locally saved dataset to apply filtering logic. Through the use of a MutationObserver, the system keeps an eye on Facebook's DOM, enabling it to identify and filter newly added comments as they are dynamically loaded. An effective debounce technique powers the filtering itself, guaranteeing seamless operation without requiring frequent page reprocessing. </h4>
<h4>The research uses natural language processing techniques for classifying the comments into positive , negative and netural. It implements the real time filtering of negative comments and hide it.</h4>

<h4>The research focuses on developing a model that hides the negative comments or bad comments from the facebook platform from the user end side. An extension is created using for hiding the negative comments form the facebook where that extension utilizing a dataset of nearly 2000 sample consists of positive,negative and netural comments .these comments are extracted from the randim facebook post.</h4>
